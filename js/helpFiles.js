	Abednedo:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Abednedo are humanoids with a long, sorrowful faces and cream-to-tan skin,<br>
	sometimes with gray spots. Tendrils dangle from either side of their mouths,<br>
	the remains of their subterranean ancestors' unique organ for navigating in the<br>
	dark. Abednedo have broad talents and tend to be clever and gregarious. They<br>
	also tend to be very curious about other races and cultures.<br>

	Abyssin:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Abyssin were a primitive and violent people, often hired as petty thugs. They<br>
	inhabited the arid desert planet Byss, where they lived as nomadic herders.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	At about two meters tall, the hulking, humanoid Abyssin had long limbs and a<br>
	single large eye that dominated their greenish-tan foreheads. They could heal<br>
	quickly which some believe contributed to an especially violent racial culture.<br>
	Abyssin could live up to 300 standard years. Elderly Abyssin lost these<br>
	regenerative abilities, and either voluntarily exiled themselves to die in the<br>
	desert, or were ritually killed by their tribe.<br>
	<br>
	Abyssin worshipped water, a precious scarcity on sun-blasted Byss. Water<br>
	supplies were closely guarded secrets and naturally occurring oasis were viewed<br>
	as holy sites. Spilling water was viewed as both wasteful and sacrilegious.<br>
	Space traders who possessed food replicators could awe Abyssin with their<br>
	god-like ability to produce infinite amounts of water.<br>
	<br>
	When two Abyssin tribes met, they would interact peacefully through trading if<br>
	both groups had plentiful water supplies. Otherwise, they began a "Blooding", a<br>
	brawl which ended only when one tribe's warriors were all killed, captured, or<br>
	incapacitated. Warriors who survived a Blooding were usually allowed to join<br>
	the winning tribe once they healed. This tradition led to some violent<br>
	incidents when spacers tried to trade with Abyssin tribes with scarce water<br>
	resources.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Short-tempered is overly generous. They are quick to anger and will usually<br>
	attack anyone who taunts them. Their culture is primitive and they show little<br>
	interest in technology. They hate space travel and blaster fire, preferring to<br>
	wrench off their opponents limbs by hand.<br>
	<br>
	Abyssin were uncommon in the greater galaxy. Those who are found off Byss are<br>
	often slaves or mercenaries. Abyssin were sometimes referred to as "monocs",<br>
	but the Abyssin often found this term insulting.<br>
	<br>
	Abyssin can speak Galactic Basic interspersed with grunts and growls<br>

	Alderaanian:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Princess Leia: But Alderaan is peaceful! We have no weapons, you can't<br>
	possibly...<br>
	Governor Tarkin: [impatiently] Would you prefer another target, a military<br>
	target? Then name the system! I grow tired of asking this so it'll be the last<br>
	time: Where is the rebel base?<br>
	Princess Leia: ...Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.<br>
	Governor Tarkin: There. See, Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. Continue with<br>
	the operation, you may fire when ready.<br>
	Princess Leia: WHAT?<br>
	Governor Tarkin: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an<br>
	effective demonstration - but don't worry: we'll deal with your rebel friends<br>
	soon enough.<br>
	<br>
	That is pretty much exactly what Alderaanians are like.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Alderaanians are identical in most physical characteristics to baseline humans,<br>
	including hair color and skin. However, because of their extreme pacifist and<br>
	philanthropic outlook, they are slightly less robust and more pensive than<br>
	other human-type species in the Galactic Core.<br>
	<br>
	Education, the arts, philosophy and studies of the human condition figure<br>
	prominently in Alderaanian culture. Alderaan is famed though out known space<br>
	for their exquisite cuisine, wine and art. Alderaanian chefs have been know to<br>
	spend years preparing for a single meal which seamlessly melds food, drink and<br>
	their patron's tastes with the living flows of the environment itself. This<br>
	same emphasis on symbiosis can be found in the Alderaanian educational and<br>
	philosophical traditions.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Alderaanians are exceedingly peaceful and knowledgeable. They are a race of<br>
	poets and philosophers who always look for solutions which avoid conflict. So<br>
	profound is their commitment to negotiation that they have had their government<br>
	grind to a halt over particularly intractable problems. They are extremely<br>
	educated and excel in most all non-confrontational fields.<br>

	Aqualish:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Aqualish were tusked bipeds from the planet Ando whose appearance combined<br>
	aspects of arachnids and aquatic mammals. Aqualish had a reputation for being<br>
	nasty, crude and aggressive.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	There are three types of Aqualish, the Aquala, the Ualaq, and the Quara. Though<br>
	Ualaq and Quara only made up about ten per cent of the Aqualish population,<br>
	their fingered hands made them more comfortable with technology. Thus, they<br>
	were the species more commonly found off-world.<br>
	<br>
	The Aquala (widely considered to be the baseline Aqualish) are tusked,<br>
	walrus-faced humanoids with skin ranging from light blue to deep rust. Adult<br>
	Aqualish stand between 1.8 and 2.0 meters tall.<br>
	<br>
	When Aqualish discovered sub light space travel capability from an exploratory<br>
	craft that they destroyed, they began a series of bloody conflicts with their<br>
	sister world. The violence became a black mark on the species' reputation, and<br>
	the Republic initiated several attempts to demilitarize the Aqualish. They have<br>
	remained through their history a reluctant member of the civilized Republic.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Aqualish admire strength and are contemptuous and hostile toward the weak. It<br>
	is socially acceptable in Aqualish culture to be pushy and belligerent when<br>
	meeting someone for the first time. If they do not stand up, Aqualish will<br>
	continue bullying them.<br>
	<br>
	Aqualish almost always end up in a shadowy trade though some find more<br>
	honorable work as a bodyguard. Concepts of urbane culture, courtesy or<br>
	diplomacy are completely foreign to the thuggish Aqualish.<br>
	<br>
	Aqualish can speak Galactic Basic but with a harsh, guttural sound due to vocal<br>
	cord limitations.<br>

	Arkanian:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Arkanian are a near-human race native, surprisingly enough, from the planet<br>
	Arkania. They are cloners, scientists and geneticists of the first order. They<br>
	are known throughout the galaxy for their amoral meddling in racial eugenics.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Arkanian look very similar to humans with white eyes and four clawed fingers.<br>
	However because of their extensive genetic experimentations and deeply<br>
	splintered sub-species, it is almost impossible to determine their racial<br>
	origins.<br>
	<br>
	Arkanians have made some of the hugest advances in all of known science but<br>
	often at the expense of other races. They see the improvement of the galactic<br>
	gene pool as their lot, not matter how huge an atrocity this might entail.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Arkanians are very arrogant and feel even their slightest whim supersede other<br>
	races 'rights' and 'laws'. They have an image as the mad scientists of the<br>
	galaxy and other races often give them a very chilly reception.<br>
	<br>
	Arkanians are doctors, scientists and engineers foremost. They have some lesser<br>
	skills in other technological oriented professions put are rarely found in<br>
	purely physical jobs. That being said, Arkanians have developed a modest<br>
	martial tradition since they are so often castigated for some medical atrocity<br>
	or another.<br>
	<br>
	This reputation led to the famous joke, An Arkanian, a Kaminoan and a Khommite<br>

	Astromech:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	An astromech droid, sometimes shortened to just an astromech or astro droid, is<br>
	a type of droid that serves as an automated mechanic, performing a variety of<br>
	repair duties and often serving as an adjunct or substitute for a nav computer<br>
	on smaller starships. Astromech droids can also use the mainframes of larger<br>
	ships to their advantage. Many starfighters use astromech copilots.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physical Construction</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	These compact droids use tool-tipped appendages stored in recessed<br>
	compartments. Astromech droids average 0.93 meters in height, while R-series<br>
	droids from the R2 line forward have a height of just over a meter. Most<br>
	astromechs move around on wheels or small treads, but a few are designed with<br>
	short, squat legs.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Most astromechs are programmed for navigation, engineering, and slicing,<br>
	although their abilities are also well-suited to surveillance. A newly<br>
	constructed or memory-wiped droid normally has a master/owner, and tends be<br>
	straightforward, analytical, nonviolent, and obedient. Even those who<br>
	understand the binary language of their beeping will find that astromechs<br>
	usually talk in terms of simple mathematical equations.<br>
	<br>
	"Jedi + T7 = win!" (T7-01, Star Wars: The Old Republic)<br>
	<br>
	If an astromech's life continues for decades or centuries without a memory<br>
	wipe, it tends to become very quirky and independent. Some may even go without<br>
	owners, learn how to tell lies, or develop other strange behavior patterns.<br>
	<br>
	Astromechs cannot speak Galactic Basic, only Binary.<br>

	Balosar:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Balosar are a frail, near-human race native to the Core World Balosar. They're<br>
	almost universally victimized and most commonly associated with the Galactic<br>
	death stick trade.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Balosar are a thin humanoid race with retractable antennae and bristly hair.<br>
	The antennae can sense strong emotions and convey very limited precognition in<br>
	dangerous situations.<br>
	<br>
	Their home world of Balosar is almost uninhabitable, the atmosphere and oceans<br>
	having been reduced to a festering mix of pollutants. Crime is endemic and the<br>
	government hugely corrupt. Native Balosar despair of any respite from their<br>
	grinding daily existence. The government freely sells pork-laden labor<br>
	contracts to off-world corporations who construct endless sweatshop factories<br>
	that carpet the planet surface.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Balosar are self-centered and weak-willed. Millennia of brutal hardships have<br>
	skewed their moral compass and they frequently wander across the line of the<br>
	law. Balosar drift into crime because there is nothing else to do on their home<br>
	world.<br>
	<br>
	Balosar are the main dealer of death sticks in the galaxy. This has led them<br>
	into a fierce competition with Twi'lek spice dealers for the galactic narcotics<br>
	trade. The enmity that has developed between Balosar and Twi'lek has made<br>

	Barabel:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Barabel were a cold-blooded reptilian species from Barab I. Many of their<br>
	actions were fueled by their hunting instincts, but this also gave way to the<br>
	general feeling that Barabels were always angry, or in the very least ornery.<br>
	The Barabel had very tough, dark colored scales.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Barabel are large reptilian humanoids with scales shaded from black to deep<br>
	red. Their bulging, slitted eyes are set above huge mouths filled with pointed<br>
	teeth. Adults stand between 1.9 and 2.2 meters.<br>
	<br>
	Barabel evolved from nocturnal predators. Their ancestors would lounge in the<br>
	intense radiation of their sun and hunt during the night.<br>
	<br>
	According to Barabel legend, a small group of Jedi came to Barab I circa 900<br>
	BBY. The Jedi helped resolve a ferocious dispute. Because of this, the Barabel<br>
	held the Jedi in very high regard. After this contact with the Jedi, the<br>
	Barabel had little contact with off-worlders for centuries. The legendary Barab<br>
	chieftain Shaka-ka formed an alliance with Imperial Governor Paro Lanto and had<br>
	the spaceport city of Alater-ka built. Some Barabel began to go off-world,<br>
	working as mercenaries and bounty hunters.<br>
	<br>
	Later, during the days of the New Republic, several Barabel became part of the<br>
	Jedi order. The most prominent of these being Saba Sebatyne.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Barabel are mean-spirited and short-tempered, taking an aggressive stance<br>
	toward almost all strangers. They treat clan-mates, siblings, parents and<br>
	especially offspring with more compassion. Barabel usually find employ as<br>
	soldiers, bodyguards or smugglers.<br>
	<br>
	Barabel can speak Galactic Basic with a heavy guttural hiss. Those who remain<br>
	on Barab I usually don't bother to learn it.<br>

	Baragwin:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Baragwin people were a species of bipedal reptilians. Though their<br>
	population numbered only in the millions, they were widespread throughout the<br>
	galaxy, having been part of galactic society for millennia. Their original<br>
	home world was lost to legend. Instead, like Humans, they identified themselves<br>
	with the planet they were raised on.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Physically, Baragwins were noted for their thick skin which could resist most<br>
	physical attacks, and their shuffling gait. This made them powerful, but slow,<br>
	warriors. They were easily recognized by their hunched backs, wrinkled skin,<br>
	and large heads mounted on thick necks. Baragwins also had an acute sense of<br>
	smell, sensitive enough to detect a person's mood. This led some of them into<br>
	careers as big-game hunters, or even as bounty hunters.<br>
	<br>
	Baragwins generally had little prejudice, treating all other beings equally<br>
	regardless of species, culture, or planetary origins (though criminal Baragwins<br>
	would exploit all beings equally instead). Baragwin settlements were generally<br>
	small and anarchic, with short-term leaders selected by informal democratic<br>
	processes. <br>
	<br>
	Baragwins were also famous as skilled weaponsmiths. During the Jedi Civil War,<br>
	Baragwin-made blasters and vibroblades were among the most powerful personal<br>
	weapons in the galaxy. This tradition continued into the Galactic Civil War<br>
	era, where Baragwins were found working for Imperial-backed corporations,<br>
	criminals, and the Alliance to Restore the Republic.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Baragwin tend to be underestimated because of their ponderous bulk and slow<br>
	gait. They are actually enormously intelligent and will actively manipulate any<br>
	species prejudice against them. They are quick to defend themselves if attacked<br>
	and usually do so quite capably.<br>
	<br>
	Baragwin are the galaxies greatest weapon smiths, though they are quite able in<br>
	any technical career. They are also one of the few engineering oriented species<br>
	that also often followed careers in the military.<br>

	Besalisk:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Besalisks were a race of many-armed humanoids from the cold ocean world of<br>
	Ojom. Besalisks evolved from large, flightless avians, though were often<br>
	mistaken for a reptillian species.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Male Besalisks had prominent crests and four arms, though the female of the<br>
	species could have as many as eight. The addition of these appendages required<br>
	a hearty metabolism, and these bulky beings were able to store food and water<br>
	for many days. If need be, they could also survive for long periods without<br>
	either. Scruffy sensory whiskers lined the area below their noses, just above<br>
	the robust wattle most adult Besalisks possessed.<br>
	<br>
	Quick-witted and sociable, Besalisks easily integrated into any civilized<br>
	society, though few Besalisk colonies existed outside of sparsely-populated<br>
	Ojom. Besalisks never sought representation in the Galactic Republic, content<br>
	to go about their business while politicians and bureaucrats ran the Galaxy.<br>
	During the rule of the Empire, Besalisks narrowly avoided enslavement by<br>
	calling in favors with various influential underworld connections - though<br>
	many Besalisks spent years working off this debt, especially those desperate<br>
	enough to seek aid from the Hutts.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Besalisks were friendly, open and sociable as likely to buy a stranger a<br>
	Corellian fire whisky as strike up a random conversation on local events. They<br>
	are honest and hard-working with little interest in larger Galactic matters.<br>
	<br>
	Besalisks often find their way into small businesses or smuggling operations<br>
	where their industriousness and social natures serve them well. Though<br>
	pleasant, when pressed Besalisks can be ferocious fighters.<br>

	Bith:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Bith were a species native to the planet Clak'dor VII. Bith were one of the<br>
	galaxy's most ancient races, with a history going back millions of years. Their<br>
	society was highly regimented, with everything from mate selection to political<br>
	leadership controlled by sophisticated computer programs.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Bith had milky-pale skin, large heads and eyes, and long fingers. Bith had<br>
	acute senses of smell, high manual dexterity, and could sense the tonal<br>
	qualities of sound as well as other races sensed colors. They could also see<br>
	microscopic details of nearby objects, but were extremely nearsighted as a<br>
	result. Their acute sense of smell partially compensated for their limited<br>
	eyesight. Bith never slept unless utterly exhausted.<br>
	<br>
	Bith were also unable to reproduce naturally, instead relying on artificial<br>
	conception and gestation. Mates brought genetic material to a Computer Mating<br>
	Service for analysis against prospective mates. Bith children were created from<br>
	genetic material from two parents, which was combined, fertilized, and<br>
	incubated for a year. The Bith's internal systems were different than most<br>
	humanoids, as the Bith had only one lung. Bith also lacked a proper nose,<br>
	instead having olfactory organs hidden in the flaps of their cheeks.<br>
	<br>
	Circa 300 BBY, the Bith city-states of Nozho and Weogar engaged in a massive<br>
	bio-chemical war over patent rights to a new hyper drive. The aftermath of the<br>
	war destroyed Clak'dor VII's ecosystem and crippled the Bith industrial<br>
	capacity, forcing the Bith to retreat to sealed cities and rely on imported<br>
	goods and machinery to keep their society functioning. It also brought out a<br>
	strong pacifistic streak in Bith culture.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Bith are dedicated pacifists and tend to be thoughtful, quiet and introverted.<br>
	They are much more interested in intellectual and aesthetic pursuits though if<br>
	pressed can make a fierce opponent.<br>
	<br>
	Bith frequently work as diplomats negotiating the peace or pursuing theoretical<br>

	Bothans were furry humanoids hailing from Bothawui and several colonies, The<br>
	Bothans were members of the Old Republic at least from 4,000 BBY, but likely<br>
	from a significantly earlier point. Though in numerous conflicts the Bothans<br>
	remained officially neutral, their famed Spynet always played each side and<br>
	commercial interests sought profits. The Bothans played a large role in the<br>
	founding of the New Republic.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Bothans stand about 1.5 meters tall and are covered with fur that ripples<br>
	according to their emotional state. They have tapered pointed ears and<br>
	typically sport beards. Bothans differ in facial structure from canine to<br>
	feline to equine.<br>
	<br>
	Bothan culture was guided by the philosophy and principles set forth in the<br>
	ancient text The Way by Golm Fervsedra. In this "Bothan Way", the pursuit of<br>
	power and influence was paramount. Thus, individual Bothans put their own<br>
	political and economic success above all other concerns, and as a species,<br>
	Bothans put their own advancement ahead of other intergalactic interests. The<br>
	volume of backstabbing, subtle character assassination and political<br>
	maneuvering in Bothan society was dizzying.<br>
	<br>
	In times of crisis, the focus of Bothan society shifted to a survivalist state<br>
	known as "Arkai". When engaged in Arkai, all fit Bothans volunteered to defend<br>
	their species from impending annihilation. The last calling of Arkai was during<br>
	the Yuuzhan Vong invasion after the death of Borsk Feylya and the practical<br>
	defeat of the New Republic.<br>

	Bothans are manipulative, crafty and suspicious. However, some have interpreted<br>
	these qualities to mean that Bothans were untrustworthy when in fact they were<br>

	Cathar:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Cathar were a race of feline, bipedal humanoids native to Cathar, a planet<br>
	of savannas and rough uplands. They were known for their loyalty, passion, and<br>
	temper.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The baseline Cathar had fur-covered bodies with thick manes. They had<br>
	prominent, retractable claws that could deliver powerful killing attacks on<br>
	foes and prey. Their bodies also possessed rapid healing abilities. On average,<br>
	Cathar were 1.5 to 1.9 meters tall. These traits made them the perfect<br>
	hand-to-hand specialists. Quick and powerful, they were considered great<br>
	warriors and dedicated, efficient predators. Cathar had high moral values,<br>
	learned from both family and society. Their females were prized as slaves,<br>
	whereas the males were generally regarded as too uncontrollable for slavery.<br>
	<br>
	On their homeworld, Cathar lived in cities built into giant trees, and were<br>
	organized into clans governed by "Elders". Stories of their great heroes were<br>
	often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to<br>
	see. The Cathar mated for life, to the extent that when one mate died, the<br>
	survivor never had a relationship with another. Cathar clan society included<br>
	great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion<br>
	included a ritual known as the "Blood Hunt", in which Cathar warriors<br>
	individually engaged in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain<br>
	honor and purge themselves of inner darkness.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Cathar are found most often employed as soldiers, bodyguards, bounty hunters,<br>
	and smugglers. Their temperaments and physical prowess serves them well in<br>
	these roles, though with smuggling, they are often part of a team, to make up<br>
	for their lack of planning skills.<br>

	Cereans were a humanoid species with long cone-like heads from the planet<br>

	Cereans possessed an enlarged skull that housed their complex binary brains.<br>
	The binary structure of Cerean thinking helped them to ponder two sides of an<br>
	issue at once. Because of their thoughtful nature, they tended to be calm,<br>
	rational, and analytical, preferring peaceful philosophies and lifestyles.<br>
	<br>
	The quick-thinking Cereans had equally quick reflexes but poor manual<br>
	dexterity. Their expansive circulatory system incorporated two hearts to fuel<br>
	their elevated mental levels.<br>
	<br>
	Cerean males aged more quickly than the females, who had similar lifespans to<br>
	Humans. Subsequently, the males were more rare than females and polygamous<br>
	marriages were a necessity in Cerean society. Each male usually had one primary<br>

	Chiss:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Chiss were a tall, blue-skinned Near-Human civilization from the planet<br>
	Csilla in the Unknown Regions, best known to most Humans as the people to which<br>
	Grand Admiral Thrawn belonged. Due to the remote position of their home<br>
	territory in the Chiss Ascendancy they remained largely an enigma to the rest<br>
	of the galaxy, and contact with outsiders was limited even in the days of the<br>
	Galactic Alliance.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Chiss were a near-Human species distinguished by their blue skin and<br>
	glowing red eyes, which grew darker depending on the oxygen content of their<br>
	surroundings. The more oxygen present, the more intense the color of their eyes<br>
	and skin tone. While their hair was typically jet black, it did on rare<br>
	occasions go gray with age (most Chiss believed that the development of gray<br>
	hair was an indication of the siring of exceptional children).<br>
	<br>
	The Chiss language was Cheunh and was first accepted during the developing<br>
	years of their civilization when they formed a planet-wide government which<br>
	consisted of a single tongue that their society accepted. It was known to be a<br>
	dense and difficult synthetic language to master as complicated ideas were<br>
	expressed by uniting unrelated words into larger words.<br>
	<br>
	Their society was highly structured and ordered with the rule of law being<br>
	enforced by a group of affiliations known as the Ruling Families, also known as<br>
	the Ruling Circle, that consisted of a number of clans or houses. These were<br>
	not biological family groupings but instead different branches of their<br>
	government. Among their ranks included the Csapla, Nuruodo, Inrokini and<br>
	Sabosen families with some sources stating that they represented bloodlines<br>
	that predated modern Chiss civilization. Every Chiss was known to have claimed<br>
	affiliation to one of the four families which was determined by both tradition<br>
	as well as place of birth. In reality, the family names were more of a cultural<br>
	holdover as the bloodlines had grown so co-meddled that any Chiss could claim<br>
	affiliation to any of the ruling families.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Chiss are disciplined, cold and arrogant. They always strive for any<br>
	tactical or social advantage. Chiss who mix with non-Chiss are always plotting<br>
	tactics to ensure their victory. They also show a great deal of interest in the<br>
	art and sciences of other cultures, studying them to gain insight into their<br>
	potential enemy.<br>
	<br>
	Chiss have a broad range of talents, most often finding expression as soldiers<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Corellians were among the first human societies to develop hyperdrive-capable<br>
	starships, and were well known for their skills as pilots, scouts, and<br>
	shipbuilders. Corellian spacers were often stereotyped as brash risk-takers.<br>
	This stereotype had a ring of truth, as many well known smugglers and gamblers<br>
	were Corellians.<br>
	<br>
	Corellians had a strong military tradition. Many Corellians served in the<br>
	Corellian Security Force (better known as CorSec), or in galactic-level<br>
	military organizations such as the Republic Navy or the Imperial Navy. For<br>

	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Dashade were tall, reptilian humanoids with dark skin and lamprey-like<br>
	mouths. They were powerful warriors and assassins. Dashade warriors easily<br>
	found employment as combat instructors for the Jedi and assassins for the Sith,<br>
	though the Dashade's aggressive culture caused them to favor the Sith. Dashade<br>
	also had powerful claws and an ability to dissipate heat which made them hard<br>
	to detect using standard life-form sensors.<br>
	<br>
	Their planet, Urkupp, was destroyed when the Cron Drift supernova exploded<br>
	during the Great Sith War. Thirty-six Dashade Shadow Killers, retainers of a<br>
	Falleen royal house, were among the off-world survivors. They were placed in<br>
	cryogenic suspension, to be revived one at a time when needed for special<br>
	assignments. By the time of the Galactic Civil War, only one known Dashade<br>
	remained Ket Maliss. Prince Xizor, a descendant of the royals who had passed<br>
	the Dashade down over the generations, inherited this warrior and made him an<br>
	assassin for Black Sun.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to these preserved warriors, rumors of Dashade sightings continued<br>

	The Witches of Dathomir were near-human Force-sensitives native to the planet<br>
	Dathomir. Most Dathomiri were descended from the fallen Jedi Knight Allya, who<br>
	was banished to the planet by the Jedi Council approx. 600 BBY. Many<br>
	generations after her death, her descendents had divided into female-dominated<br>
	clans that were named after regional landmarks. Each clan had a unique set of<br>
	rules regarding Force usage, but all the clans held one rule above all others,<br>
	the last line of their sacred Book of Law "Never concede to evil".<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Dathomiri are a race of near-human force sensitives. They possessed a very<br>
	similar build to humans with the exception of pointed ears, slightly feline set<br>
	eyes and skin colors that ranged from light brown to dark grey.<br>
	<br>
	Dathomiri clans lived in a simple village and adhered to a matriarichal<br>
	society, where men were used only for breeding and slave labour. Women chose<br>
	their men by capturing them, but if the man was unhappy, the woman had the<br>
	right to sell him to another clan sister. The only way a man could go free was<br>
	if he saved the life of a clan sister.<br>
	<br>
	As a warrior-based society, the Dathomiri Witches trained daily in the art of<br>
	war, and used both their muscles and the Force to aid them in combat. They wore<br>
	their hair in elaborate braids (sometimes with a helmet decorated with<br>
	mementos) and lizard skin armour.<br>
	<br>
	The Force was used by the Witches in the form of "spells". There were spells<br>
	that are called the Night Spells, and excessive use of those could turn a Witch<br>
	into a Nightsister. If a Nightsister wished to forsake her dark past and return<br>
	to the clan, she had to have a period of exile for purification purposes before<br>
	she would be allowed back.<br>

	"There was no danger. Humans need movement to see. Unmoving shadows are of no
	concern."<br>
	-- unnamed Defel <br>
	<br>
	The Defel (colloquially known as Wraiths) were barely visible beings who<br>
	appeared to most other species as shadows. Typically, they were employed as<br>
	mercenaries or guards. They were from Af'El, a large, high-gravity,<br>
	seldom-visited world orbiting the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. Af'El had no<br>
	ozone layer and ultraviolet light passed freely to the surface, while other<br>
	light wavelengths were blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's atmosphere.<br>
	Thus, all lifeforms on Af'El could only see in ultraviolet light ranges, and<br>
	were blind to other wavelengths of light.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Defel were short, stocky beings, averaging 1.3 meters in both height and width<br>
	at the shoulders. Though they were nearly invisible in normal light, Defel were<br>
	actually colorful beings. Viewed under ultraviolet light, their fur appeared in<br>
	colors ranging from yellow to blue. Their snouts appeared green, with orange,<br>
	gill-like slits at the base of their jawlines. Elderly Defel actually lost<br>
	their ability to absorb light, fading to a dull dark brown under visible light.<br>
	<br>
	Due to the harsh conditions of Af'El, Defel had a society based on<br>
	communalresource sharing. Co-operation was vital for survival. The typical<br>
	Defel was a tough, independent being, with a strong sense of honor. Defel stood<br>
	by their word, and refused to associate with anyone who broke a promise. The<br>
	Defel lived in underground cities to escape Af'El's violent storms. Their<br>
	subterranean society had developed highly advanced mining and metallurgical<br>
	technology, though they had not developed space travel or agriculture on their<br>
	own.<br>
	<br>
	Their homeworld was seldom visited due to the difficulty of escaping its<br>
	gravity well. They did see some trade in meleenium, a rare substance used in<br>
	Wdurasteel production, which was only found naturally on Af'El. During the<br>
	WImperial era, Vulca Minerals sent one ship a year to the Defel to trade fresh<br>

	'I know the difference between a Devaronian and a demon, and I'd sooner trust a<br>
	demon.'<br>
	-- Naradan D'ulin <br>
	<br>
	Devaronians were a horned humanoid species from the world of Devaron in the<br>
	Expansion Region, a planet of low mountains and deep valleys linked by<br>
	thousands of rivers. It is believed that they were descended from a race of<br>
	primates that lived in the mountains of Devaron.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Devaronians were one of the most unique races in the galaxy, as their male<br>
	and female sexes were so vastly different in appearance and temperament. The<br>
	males were aggressive by nature, many being described as brash or bull-headed,<br>
	with typically red-tinted skin and a pair of large horns growing from their<br>
	heads. They took great pride in their horns, and groomed them quite regularly.<br>
	Female Devaronians were covered in thick fur that ranged in color from brown to<br>
	white. They were also hornless and had prominent canine teeth and unlike the<br>
	males, they were docile, non-aggressive creatures who tended to be dominant in<br>
	their culture, being the only ones allowed to participate in government and<br>
	politics. The bodies of both males and females were denser than most humanoids'<br>
	and as a result they were heavier than their appearance would tend to indicate.<br>
	<br>
	Devaronians were one of the first species in the galaxy to develop interstellar<br>
	travel, and the males of the species had been common sights in spaceports<br>
	throughout the galaxy for thousands of years by the time of the Galactic Civil<br>
	War. Devaronian males were driven by an urge to wander, usually taking the<br>
	first opportunity to move on from one place to another. As such, they were<br>
	often found traveling the galaxy as tramp freighter captains and scouts.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	<br>
	Devaronians, mostly the males; usually find employment in jobs that allow a<br>
	great deal of freedom. They are commonly scouts, soldiers, and pilots. Females,<br>
	if they are the rare sort who leave Devaron, usually take up similar<br>
	professions.<br>

	Draethos:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Draethos were a predatory humanoid species from the planet Thosa, notable for<br>
	their long natural lifespans.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Draethos possessed large teeth, which grew outside of their mouths in what<br>
	appeared to be an overbite. They also had no lips, further exaggerating the<br>
	appearance of an overbite. Their scaly skin ranged in color from blue to purple<br>
	to black. Their hands retained an interstitial web between the fingers. Their<br>
	fingers ended in narrow tips which resembled claws. They possessed low-light<br>
	vision, springing from their cave-dwelling ancestors.<br>
	<br>
	Draethos, warrior and intellectual alike, possessed telepathy, including the<br>
	ability to communicate with any sentient being in a radius of approximately<br>
	five hundred meters. The ability was limited to communication; a Draethos could<br>
	not invade the thoughts of others.<br>
	<br>
	The Draethos could live to be a thousand years and older. Despite their long<br>
	lives, their childhood was quite short. They matured quickly, grew out of<br>
	adolescence at 18, then enjoyed a healthy adulthood which lasted approximately<br>
	four hundred years. At four hundred a Draethos was considered middle aged. It<br>
	was not until age seven hundred that a Draethos was considered elderly. Partly<br>
	due to their long lives, Draethos society was slow to evolve and relied heavily<br>
	on tradition. The Draethos was a warrior culture. Those living on the homeworld<br>
	were expected to demonstrate their martial or hunting prowess. Life on Thosa<br>
	was harsh, with arrogant aristocrats squabbling among one another for social<br>
	standing and wealth. Warriors were perpetually in high demand as gladiators,<br>
	mercenaries, hunters, and soldiers.<br>
	<br>
	Pacifistic philosophies were despised on Draethos. Those who made a conscious<br>
	decision to abandon the way of the warrior were exiled to seek a new life among<br>
	aliens. Therefore, paradoxically, despite their reputation as fierce<br>
	combatants, most Draethos encountered offworld were peaceful and intellectual.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Draethos traveling offworld were usually exiles who chose not to become<br>
	warriors as their culture demanded and thus were highly intelligent and<br>

	"Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with<br>
	a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug."<br>
	-- Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine <br>
	<br>
	Dugs were a species native to the planet Malastare with a well-deserved<br>
	reputation for unnecessary brutality and mean-spiritedness.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Dugs were slender, powerfully built beings with a somewhat humanoid build.<br>
	Their high gravity homeworld Malastare gave Dugs a unique method of walking.<br>
	Their strong arms were used as legs, and their lower limbs were used as arms.<br>
	<br>
	Dugs had smooth skin, which hung loosely around their necks, only to inflate<br>
	during mating season calls. They also possessed fin-like ears and pronounced<br>
	snouts. They lived mainly in the forests of the western continent of their<br>
	homeworld in primitive tree villages called "tree thorps". On their homeworld<br>
	Malastare, the Dugs were arboreal beings, brachiating among the canopies with<br>
	alarming speed.<br>
	<br>
	Dugs have been brutally repressed by the Gran who colonized Malastare. The vast<br>
	majority of Dugs were little more than labourers toiling for the enrichment of<br>
	the Gran. With the species excluded from much of the power and money on<br>
	Malastare, many Dugs, such as Sebulba, turned to podracing. In all other areas,<br>
	the Dugs were exploited and disenfranchized.<br>
	<br>
	Dugs often felt the need to throw around their strength in bids to establish<br>
	dominance. As a result, they were known for their ill-tempered demeanor, and<br>
	many were little more than bullying thugs.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Dugs are adversarial, derogatory, selfish and bullying. They will push around<br>
	those weaker than them and act subservient to their superiors. Dugs are<br>
	fringers and scoundrels with phenomenal piloting skills. They could not be<br>
	bothered with diplomacy.<br>
	<br>
	Because of Dugs history with Gran, there is NO CHANCE of co-operation between<br>
	the two on any level.<br>
	<br>

	Duros:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Duros, sometimes known as Durosians, were an amphibian species native to<br>
	the planet Duro which were said to be among the Galaxy's first spacefaring<br>
	races. Their homeworld was located on both the Corellian Trade Spine and at the<br>
	end of the Duros Space Run, two major hyperspace routes that linked Duro with<br>
	other important commercial centers.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Duros were easily distinguished as humanoids with smooth blue-green skin,<br>
	red eyes, lipless mouths and long thin noseless faces. Both females and males<br>
	had hairless scalps though both genders were easily distinguished. Their large<br>
	red goggle-like eyes also had slit pupils.<br>
	<br>
	While usually taciturn, Duros enjoyed telling stories about their travels. The<br>
	majority of Duros were pilots and explorers and were adventurous, though<br>
	sometimes rash. As one of the first cultures to develop hyperdrive spacecraft<br>
	(some even believe the first), Duros-charted trade routes were among the oldest<br>
	hyperspace routes still in use. The Duros established a vast, grand starship<br>
	construction industry in the Duro system that rivalled the one in the Corellian<br>
	system. The Duros set up their government around a consortium of starship<br>
	construction corporations.<br>
	<br>
	The Duros were also one of the founding races of the Galactic Republic. Years<br>
	before the formation of the Republic, the Duros colonized the planet Neimoidia,<br>
	giving rise to a genetically distinct 'newer version' of Duros, the<br>
	Neimoidians. The Neimoidians retained many similarities to their Duros cousins<br>
	including basic form, noseless faces, and green skin. Because Neimoidians<br>
	tended to be cowardly, greedy and fearful of death, one of the most powerful<br>
	insults among the Duros was to be called a Neimoidian.<br>

	--An Echani Poem <br>
	<br>
	The Echani are the followers of a warrior ethos similar to their rivals, the<br>
	Mandalorians. Echani use light armor and weapons, stressing precision and<br>
	agility rather than brute force.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Echani are baseline humans who've transformed their bodies through lifelong<br>
	commitment to the art of combat.<br>
	<br>
	Combat is central to all aspects of an Echani's life. For Echani, combat was<br>
	communication, interpersonal expression, intimacy and emotion. They can learn<br>
	nearly everything about a person through combat, intuiting their feelings,<br>
	thoughts and even personal background.<br>
	<br>
	The Echani primarily used light melee weapons, such as vibroswords and rykk<br>
	blades. The Echani avoided armor when possible, preferring to fight in<br>
	standard clothing. Anything that slowed their movement would be avoided.<br>
	<br>
	Their warrior traditions gave rise to the Sun Guard of Thrysus and later the<br>
	Emperor's Royal Guard.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Echani derive their sense of worth from combat, their entire culture revolving<br>
	around war as an honorable expression of self.<br>
	<br>
	Echani almost always end up working as soldiers, bodyguards, bounty hunters and<br>
	mercenaries if the assignment is an adequate test of their skill. Whatever path<br>

	Falleen:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Falleen were the indigenous species of the planet Falleen. The Falleen were an<br>
	exotic, cold-blooded reptilian species known to be as long lived as Hutts, with<br>
	life spans averaging 250 years.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The sleek symmetry of their features, calculating and cold demeanours, their<br>
	exotic looks and ability to alter their skin pigmentation meant that the<br>
	Falleen were often considered beautiful. The Falleen also naturally exuded<br>
	pheromones which made them all but irresistable to the opposite sex. They had<br>
	small scales all over their bodies, as well as slightly clawed fingers and<br>
	toes.<br>
	Falleen society was of a feudal nature, with noble houses ruling over the lower<br>
	classes. The upper echelons of Falleen monarchies were rife with politics and<br>
	intrigue, but they rarely spilled over into blatant disputes or open warfare.<br>
	As a cold-blooded species, the Falleen respected discipline and control,<br>
	particularly self-control. They tended to shun public displays of emotion, and<br>
	were very patient. As a result of this attitude, they tended to look down on<br>
	the more openly passionate, whom they saw as lacking self-control. Indeed, the<br>
	Falleen as a species had a towering sense of superiority which they felt was<br>
	only right and proper due to their discipline and rigid self-control<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>

	The Feeorin were a bipedal species of sapients that spread across the Outer Rim<br>

	Invasion of Naboo.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The average Feeorin had thick tendrils hanging from the backs of their heads<br>
	(similar to those of the amphibious Nautolans) and had mottled skin ranging<br>
	from yellow to green and blue. A few examples had jet-black or white skin<br>
	pigmentation. The Feeorin could live for up to four hundred years, and due to a<br>
	unique metabolism, they grew stronger with age rather than weaker. Curiously,<br>
	some Feeorins had noses while others lacked any nasal openings.<br>
	Many of the Feeorin colony ships never reached their destination, and the<br>
	survivors were seen as raiders and scavengers by the natives of their settled<br>
	worlds. It was apparently rare for Feeorin to become Jedi.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Well known as pirates and explorers, Feeorin can be very headstrong. Willful<br>
	and more than occasionally aggressive, Feeorin make the most of their long<br>
	lives, and their ever-growing strength, pursuing their goals with zeal<br>

	Firrerreo:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Firrerreo (also referred to as Firrerreon) were natives of the planet<br>
	Firrerre. The race believed that one could 'own' anothers name, and therefore<br>
	would almost never give out their name to another, unless it was their mate or<br>
	close friend. Speaking another's name was considered a form of power, and so<br>
	would do so at any chance they had.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Firrereos closely resembled humans, but had two-tone hair and nictitating<br>
	eyelids. In addition, they had gold-colored skin, which would turn silver when<br>
	scarred.<br>
	<br>
	Their society was organised in clans, and members of one clan would care little<br>
	for the wellbeing of non-clanmembers.<br>
	<br>
	Little is known about the race as they are believed extinct after the Empire<br>
	era. Hethrir, a Firrerreo apprentice to Darth Vader, destroyed Firrerre taking<br>
	a small number of Firrerreo captive.<br>
	<br>
	IMPORTANT: Firrerreos guard their names closely. The use of a Firrerreo's true<br>
	name compels the Firrerreo to do whatever the speaker says. If you are a<br>
	Firrerreo and someone learns your true name and uses it to make you do things,<br>
	you MUST comply. Normal PK and clan backstab rules apply. For example, you may<br>
	not force a Firrerreo to attack someone unless you have a reason to attack that<br>
	person yourself, and you may not force a Firrerreo to betray his or her clan<br>
	unless they first get a spyapp approved.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Firrerreo are clannish and secretive, only trusting those extremely close to<br>
	them. It takes either an extraordinary act or an equally extraordinary length<br>
	of time for non-clan members to gain the trust of a Firrerreo. Firrerreos have<br>
	a natural affinity with the Force. For example, Hethrir's Force potential was<br>
	sufficiently high enough that Darth Vader apprenticed him despite the Empire's<br>
	normally xenophobic stance.<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Green skinned, with pig-like snouts, Gamorreans rank among the Galaxy's<br>
	best labourers and mercenaries. They also have impressive stamina, allowing<br>
	them to withstand large amounts of physical trauma. One of their favorite<br>
	weapons was a giant ritualized axe, the arg'garok.<br>
	<br>
	Their homeworld, Gamorr, is also home to a parasitic species called morrts.<br>
	Gamorreans have great affection for these creatures, finding them cute and<br>
	cuddly. The number of morrts feeding on a Gamorrean is a symbol of status <br>
	among males with a Clan warlord having 20 or more.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gamorreans are brutish and proud. They respect physical prowess, and those<br>

	Gand:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gands were sentient insectoid species who evolved on the homonymous ammonia-gas<br>
	planet Gand. Gands required a special breathing gear to manage potentially<br>
	poisonous off world gas mixtures. It has been speculated that Gand evolved from<br>
	insects but Gand will not allow themselves to be studied.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gand were stocky humanoids covered in a chitinous exoskeleton and could see in<br>
	the ultraviolet spectrum. They possessed large, bug-like eyes and only three<br>
	fingers on each hand. Gand did not respire, as they obtained all the metabolic<br>
	ingredients they need through the ingestion of their food.<br>
	<br>
	Gand society placed heavy importance on the achievements of an individual and<br>
	possessed and held that an individual had no name, and thus no worth, until he<br>
	proved otherwise.<br>
	<br>
	Young or unproven Gand were all called "Gand", a first feat earned the use of a<br>
	family surname, and a second allowed for the use of a chosen first name, all<br>
	with third-person self-reference.<br>
	<br>
	Use of the first person was considered arrogant, as it implied that those a<br>
	Gand was speaking to should already know his identity. Once a Gand became<br>
	Janwuine, this was considered a reasonable presumption, as all other Gand would<br>
	know his name and accomplishments.<br>
	<br>
	Within Gand society, a select few felt the call to the path of the Findsman. A<br>
	Findsman interpreted the movements of gasses on Gand to prophesize the location<br>
	of criminals. Part shaman, part law enforcer, a Findsman would augur the<br>
	location of a fugitive, track him and bring him to justice.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gand are soft-spoken and polite. Even the most accomplished Gand will downplay<br>
	his achievements. Gands who leave their home world are soldiers, bounty hunters<br>
	and scoundrels. Their collective mentality lends itself toward military<br>
	careers. Gand who pursue criminals view it as a spiritual endeavor, following<br>
	subtle patterns toward their prey.<br>

	Geonosians resided in hive colonies in organic-looking spires. Notable<br>
	Geonosians include Poggle the Lesser, Gizor Dellso, and Sun Fac, all three of<br>
	whom held important roles in the Confederacy of Independent Systems.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	All Geonosians had a hard exoskeleton that provided protection from physical<br>
	impacts and bouts of radiation that occasionally showered their world,<br>
	elongated faces, multi-jointed limbs, and spoke in a strange clicking language.<br>
	Geonosians were strong despite their thin builds.<br>
	<br>
	They were barbaric and viewed brutal violence as entertainment. They enjoyed<br>
	watching victims trying to survive in massive execution arenas while savage<br>
	creatures vied for their blood.<br>
	<br>
	In Geonosian society there were two main types of Geonosians: the wingless<br>
	drones that mostly worked as laborers and soldiers, and the winged aristocrat.<br>
	Though most Geonosians were content to live within their assigned castes, a few<br>
	developed ambition and aspired to ascend socially.<br>
	<br>
	Even those with the capacity to depart rarely left Geonosis. The importance of<br>
	the hive was strongly ingrained in the Geonosian mind, and they were also<br>
	contemptuous of other species. The few that ventured offworld usually left as<br>
	work groups that ultimately benefited their home hives.<br>

	Givin:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Givin were the indigenous people of the planet Yag'Dhul. They were best<br>
	known for the natural mathematical ability which made them expert starship<br>
	builders and astrogators, and for their skeletal appearance.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Givin appeared to be living humanoid skeletons, because of their hard, pale<br>
	white "skin" and deep sunken black eyes. Though they had five-fingered hands,<br>
	they had two-toed feet. They carried their arms and legs "held out" from their<br>
	bodies, making their appearance even more bizarre. Some likened their stance to<br>
	Twi'lek string puppets. Due to a complex system of moons that created<br>
	atmospheric tidal upheavals on Yag'Dhul, the Givin evolved a hard exoskeleton<br>
	that could seal all external orifices to protect against sudden<br>
	depressurization and temperature changes. It also provided protection from<br>
	physical harm. Thus, Givin had a phobia of exposed skin, and would avoid seeing<br>
	it in others whenever possible. In order to maintain this sealed system, Givin<br>
	needed to eat approximately three times more than Humans of the same mass.<br>
	Givin could easily survive in total vacuum for a standard day.<br>
	<br>
	Givin were highly intelligent, and had such a propensity for mathematics that<br>
	their society was ruled over by a mathematical theocracy, or mathematocracy,<br>
	with the greatest mathematicians serving in the ruling Body Calculus. Their<br>
	mathematical skills were, like their sealed exoskeletons, adaptations to<br>
	Yag'Dhul's complex tidal systems. Their mathematics were developed to predict<br>
	Yag'Dhul's randomly shifting oceans and atmosphere. The planetary governor of<br>
	Yag'Dhul was decided by contests that involved calculations of complex<br>
	multidimensional differentials, and all political decisions were based on<br>
	null-modal probability.<br>
	<br>
	They spent as much time designing their starships mathematically as it took to<br>
	build them, and so created some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek<br>
	ships in the galaxy. Often, other species would need to modify a purchased<br>
	Givin starship, installing a navicomputer or pressurization system which would<br>
	often be left out as unnecessary by the Givin (who could survive in vacuum and<br>
	calculated navigational vectors in their heads.)<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Givin are great thinkers, designer, and engineers. Their mental prowess and<br>
	naturally quick thought also make them tactically strong leaders.<br>
	<br>
	Prone to analytical thought, and much debate before reaching a conclusion,<br>
	Givin are often taken by other races to be timid, until the Givin makes up her<br>

	Gotals were a species of tall, hairy humanoid sentients native to the moon<br>

	the top of their heads, which acted as highly responsive electromagnetic<br>

	another being's electromagnetic emissions from emotional changes, making Gotals<br>
	natural empaths. The unique nature of these sensors shaped Gotal culture, and<br>
	helped individual Gotals carve niches in galactic society ranging from bounty<br>
	hunters to diplomats, the former making a large use of thermite grenades.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gotals possessed cranial horns as receptors to sense electromagnetism and other<br>
	energy emissions. These nerve-ending filled cones could sense the natural<br>
	electromagnetic fields produced by Antar, Prindaar, and Antar 4's<br>
	magnetite-rich crust, allowing the species to operate even in total darkness.<br>
	Their senses also picked up the electromagnetic auras from other life forms.<br>
	Gotal hunters could sense their quarry from up to ten kilometers away, and<br>
	could track herds of quivry for weeks.<br>
	<br>
	Horns were the primary physical feature Gotals found attractive in one another.<br>
	In fact, while smaller cones could be just as energy sensitive as large ones,<br>
	small-horned Gotals frequently enhanced their appearance with larger false<br>
	cones. Some Gotals became romantically attached to non-Gotals, but they only<br>
	seemed to be sexually attracted to other creatures with cones or horns on their<br>
	heads.<br>
	<br>
	In addition to sensing energy emissions in their environment and the presence<br>
	of their prey animals, Gotals used their cones to monitor subtle changes in one<br>
	another's electromagnetic auras. This ability to quickly and easily judge<br>
	another Gotal's emotional state was fundamental to their culture. Gotal<br>
	communities were considered among the most harmonious civilizations in the<br>
	galaxy. They had difficulty interpreting the emotions of other alien species,<br>
	however, often mistaking basic emotions such as affection or anger for extremes<br>
	such as love and murderous intent.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gotals can be found working as mercenaries or bounty hunters. Some Gotals even<br>

	Gungan:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Gungans were humanoids native to the planet of Naboo.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Gungans were separated into two races: the lanky orange or purple-skinned<br>
	Otolla race, and the heavier green-skinned Ankura race. However, they all<br>
	exhibited many of the same physical traits. Starting life as tadpoles, Gungans<br>
	developed into tall beings with extremely flexible cartilaginous skeletons<br>
	(composed of resilient cartilage). Strong leg muscles allowed for powerful and<br>
	quick frog-kick style swimming through water as well as a remarkable jumping<br>
	ability while on land. Fin-like ears (called haillu) also aided them in<br>
	swimming, as well as expressing emotions like aggression, friendship, and fear.<br>
	They had partially retractable eyestalks with nictitating membranes when<br>
	underwater.<br>
	<br>
	Expressive faces and long bills with flaring nostrils were signatures of Gungan<br>
	physiology. Lengthy muscular tongues and large blunt teeth allowed them to eat<br>
	lesser amphibians, while a layer of tough skin on the head allowed for<br>
	burrowing. A Gungan's arms ended in four digits, and their feet had three<br>
	stubby toes. Females were smaller with sleeker faces and tended to tie their<br>
	ears back. As male Gungans aged, some developed prominent whiskers, resembling<br>
	those common on some species of fish. Gungans had nostrils that sealed when<br>
	they entered the water. They also boasted very strong lungs, allowing them to<br>
	both hold their breath for extended periods of time and to withstand the<br>
	pressure of deep water, along with well-padded kneecaps and powerful calves and<br>
	legs for increased swimming speed. However, because they were so well-adapted<br>
	to their watery environment, their skin dried easily in hot and arid climates.<br>
	<br>
	Gungans were basically a generous and peaceful people. They loved to have<br>
	vistors, and welcomed them with love and kindness, though it should be noted<br>
	that Gungans would be suspicious of them until the visitors had earned their<br>
	respect. Also, Gungans were not tolerant of anyone who threatened their<br>
	peaceful culture. They had very strict laws, and would go to the extremes to<br>
	punish anyone who had committed a minor crime. Vandals, for example, could be<br>
	given a sentence of exile, caning, or even stoning. If a Gungan was cast out<br>
	of society, it was very difficult for them to return. If they did manage to<br>
	return, they would often be subjected to large amounts of discrimination. This<br>
	could make life very difficult for them and could go on for months or years,<br>
	until their past offenses disappeared from memory.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Gungans can be found within almost any profession in the galaxy at large,<br>
	though they are most commonly seen as soldiers, smugglers, or even as bounty<br>
	hunters and mercenaries. Most gungans have a strong sense of loyalty, and as<br>
	such are valued as a part of any military organization.<br>
	<br>
	Gungans speak Galactic Standard Basic, though it is often inflected heavily<br>

	Hapan:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Hapans were the near-human natives of the Hapes Cluster. On the surface, they<br>
	were identical to Humans, but possessed poor night vision and were considered<br>
	to be much more beautiful than Humans.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Hapans were biologically the same as Humans, but the main difference is that<br>
	the Hapans were bred over many generations to be beautiful. Over many<br>
	generations, due to the isolation of the Hapes Cluster, the whole population<br>
	became more comely due to the limited gene pool infused with beautiful Lorell<br>
	raider captives.<br>
	<br>
	Another trait that Hapans possessed was their night blindness. Because of the<br>
	perpetual daylight of Hapes and other planets in the Cluster due to the density<br>
	of stars in the region, the Hapans have lost all ability to see in the dark,<br>
	and were nearly blind even in dim lighting.<br>
	<br>
	Most of the male population was wiped out by the Jedi around 3,000 BBY and the<br>
	Hapans adopted a matriarchial society ruled by a Queen Mother. The first Queen<br>
	Mother closed the borders of the Hapes Cluster to the rest of the galaxy and<br>
	the Hapans dealt with intruders lethally.<br>
	<br>
	Over the years, interaction between Hapans and the rest of the Galaxy was<br>
	extremely limited, due to their enforced isolation. However, in 8 ABY, the<br>
	Hapans opened their borders to the rest of the galaxy, and it has since been<br>
	much easier to spot a Hapan that it has been in the past.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Hapans are beautiful and graceful, extraordinarily deft in social situations as<br>

	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Full-grown adult Hutts are obese creatures, weighing as much as a metric ton.<br>
	Unsurprisingly, they are often semi-sedentiary, spending their days lounging<br>

	slaves. Most of their bulk rests in their bulging belly and thick, slug-like<br>
	tail, adding to the impression of bloated corruption.<br>
	<br>
	Hutt Space is powerful in its own right, comprising a large area of space<br>
	on the Outer Rim. Huttese, the native language of the Hutts, is widely<br>
	spoken by subjugated races. All Hutts have a 'given name' which is then<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Iktotchi were hairless with a very tough skin, protecting them from the violent<br>
	winds of Iktotch. Both males and females had horns that curved down around<br>
	their shoulders. Their fearsome visage is instantly recognizable throughout the<br>
	Galaxy. Males' horns were generally a little larger than those of females.<br>
	<br>
	They had poor manual dexterity with thick fingers poorly suited for delicate<br>
	work. Iktotchi measured on average 1.80 meters with a very powerful build.<br>
	Their life expectancy was approximately 90 years.<br>
	<br>
	Iktotchi had a gift of precognition (direct knowledge or perception of the<br>
	future) which was relatively effective on their native world, but very limited<br>
	as soon as they moved away from Iktotch. Despite their fierce appearance,<br>
	Iktotchi are quite empathetic, masking their deeper emotions under a mask of<br>
	stoicism.<br>
	<br>
	Respectful of the other cultures, they could adapt to civilization. However<br>

	<br>
	Ithorians were a species of intelligent herbivores from the planet Ithor, a<br>
	lush world with sprawling rain forests. They were commonly called "Hammerheads"<br>
	because of their long, curving neck and T-shaped head though they find this<br>

	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Ithorians had two mouths and glossy, brown flesh. They are somewhat larger and<br>
	more muscular than Humans. Their long necks curved forward and end in<br>
	dome-shaped heads.<br>
	<br>
	Ithorians were devoted environmentalists, staunch herbivores, and complete<br>
	pacifists. Many became galactic traders who peacefully travelled the stars in<br>
	giant herd ships. They would only resort to violence if threatened. Because of<br>
	their mild demeanor, most Ithorians avoided the Galactic Civil War, although a<br>
	few joined the Rebel Alliance.<br>
	<br>
	Ithorians integrated well with the galactic community, traveling the Galaxy in<br>
	giant Herdships. Each Ithorian herd was presided over by a Force-sensitive<br>
	Herdmaster who served as both a priest and healer.<br>
	<br>
	Ithorian Jedi could also create devastating shock waves with their four<br>
	throats. They blew out air with extreme power, enough to destroy walls and<br>
	shatter iron. This technique was used twice by Jedi Master Roron Corobb, to<br>

	Jawas are short humanoid natives of Tatooine. Often scavengers, seeking out<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Many Jawas were about 1 meter tall, and were characterized by their brown<br>
	robes, yellow eyes, and quickly spoken language called Jawaese that included<br>
	words such as "Utinni!". They were rodent-like in appearance, usually obscured<br>
	by a shroud of cloth.<br>
	<br>
	Their particular stench, which most other species found repugnant, was because<br>
	of a mysterious solution into which Jawas dip their clothes to retain moisture.<br>
	To Jawas, the odor was packed with information about each other, such as clan<br>
	lineage, health, emotional state, even the last meal eaten. Jawas also evolved<br>
	several important survival traits, such as exceptional night vision, a strong<br>
	Immune system, and an efficient digestive system.<br>
	<br>
	Jawas had long been scavengers, as the Dune Sea provided a bounty of refuse. It<br>
	was littered with spacecraft wreckage from millennia of star travel. The Jawas<br>
	built homes and tools from these ancient scraps, and traveled the dunes in<br>
	sandcrawlers, cast-off mobile smelters from failed outlander mining attempts.<br>
	Jawas lived in clans, each with distinct territories for living and scavenging.<br>
	In most Jawa clans, half the clan worked and lived in the sandcrawlers while<br>
	the other family units dwelled in fortresses deep in the desert where collected<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Kaleesh had reddish-brown scaly skin, four-clawed hands, and five-clawed toes.<br>
	Each Kaleesh hand featured two opposable thumbs. Because of the thermal pits<br>
	under their eyes, Kaleesh could see in the dark. Tusks protruded from their<br>
	upper jaw, and shorter ones jutted from their chins. Kaleesh had large pointed<br>
	ears and long nostrils that stretched close to their eyes. Most of these facial<br>
	features were obscured behind the traditional masks they wore, and outsiders<br>
	rarely saw Kaleesh unmasked. They were known to practice polygyny, where a male<br>
	courts multiple wives. This could possibly be a sociocultural adaptation<br>
	created out of a need to consolidate power among individual tribes, but the<br>
	exact social meaning behind the practice is unknown.<br>
	<br>
	The Kaleesh were a spiritual people, believing that those who performed great<br>
	deeds in life became gods in death. Therefore, burial places were sacred to<br>
	them. A large number of temples were devoted to their ancestor gods, the<br>
	holiest of which was called Shrupak. Abesmi, a great monolith of stone in the<br>
	Jenuwaa Sea, was the place the Kaleesh believed the gods ascended to the<br>
	heavens. Pilgrims took the perilous voyage to Abesmi to beseech the gods. <br>
	Their society was divided into numerous tribes. War was viewed as an essential<br>
	and sacred practice, and the culture's large emphasis on honor was known to<br>
	spur many acts of vengeance among the various tribes. However, when necessary,<br>
	the tribes would put aside their differences and bond to fend off a common<br>

	take a behind the scenes approach, preferring their deeds to be talked of<br>

	wore a large, pale collar around their necks. The Kaminoans are best known for<br>
	their abilities as cloners.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The species' evolution from aquatic creatures in the vast oceans of Kamino is<br>
	reflected in their tall shape, glassy coated eyes, near luminescent skin, and<br>
	long, thin necks. There were several peculiarities about the particulars of<br>
	KaminoanPhysiology: digitigrade and slender legs, once adapted for firm<br>
	seabeds, eventually only saw use in the hallways of their science facilities.<br>
	The almond-shaped eyes of Kaminoans were also able to see color in the<br>
	ultraviolet spectrum. Therefore, what appeared as white dwellings were actually<br>
	colored with shades that Humans and a number of other species could not see.<br>
	<br>
	Kaminoans matured quickly, reaching full adulthood at 11 years and remaining at<br>
	their adult physical prime until roughly the age of 40. They began to show<br>
	signs of their age around 80 years. Female Kaminoans were bald, while males<br>
	possessed headcrests and fin ridges along the rear of their small, bulbous<br>
	skulls.<br>
	<br>
	There also appeared to be a caste distinction between certain Kaminoans, which<br>
	could be determined by the color of the Kaminoan's eyes. The highest-level<br>
	caste members in Kaminoan society had gray eyes, the middle classes had yellow<br>
	eyes, and the lower classes had blue colored eyes. Eye color was directly<br>
	related to the type of work a Kaminoan would be used for. Gray eyed individuals<br>
	handled administration, yellow eyes handled the skilled work and blue eyes<br>
	performed manual labor and other menial tasks.<br>

	Kaminoans are renown for their high expertise in the field of medicine, more<br>
	specifically, cloning. In addition to being excellent physicians, Kaminoans do<br>
	exceedingly well as engineers, scientists, slicers, pilots and espionage<br>
	agents. Most Kaminoans will find themselves fitting in comfortably as doctors<br>
	even if their perceived lack of social graces initially turn potential clients<br>
	away.<br>

	Kel_dor:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Kel Dor, sometimes referred to as Kel Dorians, were a species hailing from<br>
	the technological planet Dorin. They required masks to protect them when in<br>
	oxygen-rich atmospheres. They were also known for their unique Force-using<br>
	tradition, the Baran Do Sages.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Kel Dor were a tall, muscular race, typically of the same height and weight<br>
	as Humans. Their skin ranged in color from peach to a crimson red. Most had<br>
	dark, black eyes, although some were born with silver irises, a mark that was<br>
	often seen as an affinity for the Force.<br>
	<br>
	Due to Dorin having a unique atmosphere, composed of helium and a gas unique to<br>
	their world, the Kel Dor had to wear an antiox breath mask and protective<br>
	goggles whenever in atmospheres of a different composition. The breath mask<br>
	also helped to amplify the Kel Dor's voice, as they must shout to produce any<br>
	sound when out of their native atmosphere. Without their protective goggles,<br>
	Kel Dor were considered effectively blind when away from Dorin.<br>
	<br>
	The Kel Dor had heightened reflexes, a result of extra-sensory organs in their<br>
	heads. As a species, they were thought to be typically quick and wise, but of a<br>
	weaker constitution, when compared to other species.<br>
	<br>
	The Kel Dor used the Force long before they joined the Galactic Republic and<br>
	the Jedi. This proud Force tradition was known as the Baran Do Sages. The Baran<br>
	Do Sages often acted as advisors to rich and powerful Kel Dor families.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	While Kel Dor typically saw moral issues in black and white, they are<br>
	even-tempered and kind. Kel Dor were noted for their hospitality, never turning<br>
	away a stranger in need. Yet, Kel Dor had no compunctions about extreme<br>
	punishments for any infraction against the law and will mete out swift justice.<br>
	<br>
	Kel Dors innate sense of right leads many to some form of law enforcement, as a<br>

	The Khommites were a species hailing from the planet Khomm. Circa 1,000 BBY The<br>
	Khommite people achieved a level of cloning technology few surpassed in the<br>
	rest of the galaxy. Believing that their society had achieved perfection,<br>
	people of Khomm begin the cloning of "perfect" individuals.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Khommites were a hairless species of near-Humans that stand between 1.6 and 2.0<br>
	meters. Small ridges run across the top of their head and their skin is<br>
	generally light to slate gray.<br>
	<br>
	Khommite came to believe their cloning technology allowed them to create<br>
	perfect individuals, customized for individual disciplines. This allowed their<br>
	society to remain unchanged for the next millennium, producing clone batches<br>
	with customized skills as needed. Viewing force sensitivity as an undesirable<br>
	fluke, the Khommites endeavored to remove the trait from their species.<br>
	<br>
	Their cities were laid out in perfect grids with square buildings. Life was<br>
	highly organized while creativity and free thought was undesirable.<br>

	The Kiffar were a Near-Human species from the planets Kiffu and Kiffex. As<br>
	such, they were sometimes mistakenly called "Kiffu".<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	About one in a hundred Kiffar had the ability to read the memories of inanimate<br>
	objects including formerly animate objects like corpses by touch, an ability<br>
	known as psychometry. It was not, however, normal for a Kiffar to be able to<br>
	read the living. Quinlan Vos was a rare exception to this rule because of his<br>
	training under Count Dooku.<br>
	<br>
	Visually, they were comparable to any Human except for their distinct facial<br>
	markings. These markings, called qukuuf, applied as tattoos when young, were<br>
	passed down through families on the mother's side, except for on those rare<br>
	occasions where an individual's mother was not a Kiffar, in which case the<br>
	father's markings were taken on. Their qukuuf were also used to indicate clan<br>
	affiliation on their homeworld.<br>
	<br>
	The traditional colors of the facial tattoos were red, yellow, and green.<br>

	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Kubaz have a rough green-black skin and bristly hair. Kubaz most striking<br>
	feature is their prehensile trunk. Although relatively new to the galactic<br>
	community at the time of the institution of the New Order, the species was<br>
	already ubiquitous throughout the Republic during the Clone Wars. Many Kubaz<br>
	abroad were spies sent to other worlds by their respective hives to learn about<br>
	other worlds' politics, cultures, and cuisine. The homeworld of Kubindi was<br>
	plagued by radiation bombardment, and many wealthy hives moved offworld to<br>
	Ku'Bakai 6, 8, and 11.<br>
	<br>
	On Kubindi, the Kubaz hives dwelled in underground nests. Each hive was ruled<br>
	by a queen, after whom the hive is named. All Kubaz within a hive were<br>
	descendants of the queen.<br>
	<br>
	Sadly, Kubindi was amongst the many worlds taken over by the Yuuzhan Vong,<br>

	Lannik were short, bipedal humanoids known for their warrior-caste society.<br>
	<br>

	The Lannik were short humanoids with pink skin and droopy-ears. The Lannik were<br>
	fearless and sometimes hotheaded and arrogant. Most often, Lannik kept clear<br>
	heads in combat, and could deduce a solution to many dangerous situations. The<br>
	Lannik were governed by the Lannik High Court.<br>
	<br>
	The Lannik homeworld was first discovered by a group of human and Duros<br>
	explorers, who brought high technology to Lannik. The natives' exposure to this<br>
	technology split Lannik society into factions, each with its own thoughts on<br>
	how to integrate that technology into their society. Conflicts raged on Lannik,<br>
	forcing the intervention of several criminal groups, and finally, the Galactic<br>
	Republic itself. The Republic restricted the amount of technology exported to<br>
	the planet. However, this did not go as planned, serving only to increase the<br>
	amount of technology on Lannik, and also entrenching crime syndicates. This led<br>
	to the rise of the terrorist group known as the Red Iaro.<br>
	<br>
	By the time of the Galactic Empire, the Lannik were all but forgotten and<br>
	rarely seen in the galaxy.<br>
	<br>

	Though hot-headed and tempermental, their fearless personas allow them to think<br>

	Lorrdian:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Lorrdians, a Human culture from the planet Lorrd in the Kanz Sector, were<br>
	genetically identical to all other baseline Humans. However, because their<br>
	unique culture and history set them apart from other Humans, so they are<br>
	classified as Near-Humans.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Lorrdians are nearly physically identical to humans the only significant<br>
	difference being Lorrdians have light tan to dark brown skin.<br>
	<br>
	During the Kanz Disorders circa 4000 BBY, the Lorrdians were enslaved by the<br>
	Argazdan rebels who had broken away from the rule of the Galactic Republic.<br>
	During the turmoil that followed, Lorrdians were forbidden by their masters<br>
	from communicating. The Lorrdians were forced to develop a system of subtle<br>
	gestures, facial expressions, and body postures to talk to each other.<br>
	Beginning as a simple battle tongue used to co-ordinate guerrilla groups, this<br>
	eventually became a sophisticated language they called "kinetic communication".<br>
	They also learned how to interpret the body language of others to determine<br>
	their emotional state and intentions with uncanny accuracy.<br>
	<br>
	Lorrdians became among the Galaxy's best mimics, able to imitate a wide variety<br>
	of mannerisms and voices (even those of many non-humans.) These skills makes<br>
	them extraordinarily adept at diplomatic and espionage work.<br>
	<br>
	After three centuries and the loss of over 500 million Lorrdian lives, the Kanz<br>
	Disorders finally ended. The newly freed Lorrdians continued to pass their<br>
	knowledge of kinetic communication down to each generation. Lorrdians became<br>
	famous for these special abilities. They also vowed never to let the galaxy<br>
	forget the lessons of the Kanz Disorders, often becoming outspoken critics of<br>
	slavery and the smuggling rings that profit from it.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Lorrdians maintain an extraordinary control of their emotions and facial and<br>
	bodily expressions. They may be experiencing tremendous anguish or joy but<br>
	non-Lorrdians would only know this if the Lorrdian allowed it to be seen.<br>
	<br>
	Lorrdians are among the galaxys best mimics and their ability to read interpret<br>

	Lorrdian Naming Conventions<br>
	<br>
	The following is an explanation of Lorrdian naming conventions. Take, for<br>
	example, the Lorrdian name Hart-and-Parn Gorra-Fiolla of Lorrd. The first pair<br>
	of names are the Father and Grandfather's names. The second pair of names are a<br>
	male then female name chosen before birth. The person's common name will be<br>
	whichever gender fits. "of Lorrd" is often incorporated when dealing with<br>

	Mandalorian:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Mandalorians were a group of clan-based people from multiple species. Their<br>
	culture revolved around that of the idea of battle and war being a source of<br>
	honour and pride in their community. The leader of the Mandalorians typically<br>
	took on the title of 'Mandalore'. Jango Fett, a Mandalorian bounty hunter,<br>
	would later provide the genetic template for Clone troopers under the Galactic<br>
	Republic.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Originally, the Mandalorians were a gray-skinned warrior race descended from<br>
	the Taungs of Coruscant. Later, members of other species joined their ranks,<br>
	until humans made up the majority.<br>
	<br>
	The Mandalorian clans were led by the warlord 'Mandalore the First', a Taung.<br>
	Eventually, they conquered a planet in the Outer Rim, which was named Mandalore<br>
	after their leader. The Taung then took the name Mandalorians and were seen by<br>
	many as the most skilled fighters in the Galaxy, thriving for battle. They were<br>
	known for their use of cutting-edge weaponry and held to a strict code of<br>
	honor.<br>
	<br>
	Mandalorian Warriors wore very distinctive battle helmets with T-shaped visors<br>
	that covered the entirety of their faces. These helmets would eventually become<br>
	strongly associated with the Mandalorian people.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Mandalorians were aggressive and war-like, their entire culture revolving<br>
	around war as a source of honor and pride. The Mandalorians were almost always<br>
	soldiers, though some worked as bounty hunters or spies. Whatever path they<br>
	chose, the end usually resulted in bloody conflict. In LotJ, ALL Mandalorians<br>
	are from human tribes - you CANNOT roleplay as a Mandalorian unless your<br>

	<br>
	Miraluka were a thoughtful, cautious, and deliberative species. They had little<br>
	interest in personal gain or glory. For social reasons, Miraluka hid their<br>
	appearance by wearing a headband, a mask, or similar concealing headwear. In<br>

	emblazoned on flesh can indicate a Mirialan's religious affiliation, whether<br>
	they've completed a certain task throughout their lifespan, or even the<br>
	possession of a unique skill or ability. The number of tattoos a Mirialan has<br>
	can even be used as an indicator of how mature a Mirialan is, elders having<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	A thin, tall species from Muunilinst, Muuns had pasty-white skin. Their bodies<br>
	were elongated and thin, with equally elongated and thin heads. They also had<br>
	three hearts.<br>
	<br>
	Muuns did not like traveling, and they usually stayed indoors. Prior to the<br>
	rise of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire, Muuns controlled the InterGalactic<br>
	Banking Clan, one of the many corporate entities in the Galaxy. During the<br>
	Clone Wars, Muuns helped the Separatists and minted new credits for planets<br>
	leaving the Republic, although the Banking Clan. Because the Muun were a<br>
	species commonly associated with the Confederacy of Independent Systems, they<br>
	were either deported from or prevented from entering Coruscant.<br>

	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Muun are opportunistic and greedy. They have a natural affinity with mathmatics<br>

	<br>
	Muun shy away from physical effort but are excellent at most other fields.<br>

	The Naboo descended from the Grizmalltian humans who fled a violent revolution<br>
	on their planet. Led by spacer Kwilaan, they colonized Naboo and settled in the<br>

	Naboo are physically identical to humans though interbreeding with Naboo<br>
	plainsfolk has led to some minor differences.<br>
	<br>
	Cultural differences led to tension between the Naboo and Gungans -- but direct<br>
	conflict was rare. Over time there was more conflict between the various human<br>
	settlements than between the Naboo and Gungans. The Gungans believed the Naboo<br>
	to be 'pompous cowards' while the Naboo believed the Gungans to be<br>
	'barbarians'. This attitude lasted until Queen Amidala united the Gungans and<br>
	Naboo to fight the Trade Federation in the Battle of Naboo.<br>
	<br>
	Naboo politics often involved large numbers of teenaged Naboo in government<br>
	work, a result of the Naboo ideal of valuing inner purity and innocence over<br>
	political ability. This often resulted in individuals receiving positions far<br>
	behind their own level of competence.<br>

	<br>
	Nautolans possessed exceptional pheromonal and olfactory sensing skills,<br>
	enhanced by their head tendrils. Within Nautolan culture, the ability to sense<br>
	pheromonal changes is an essential part of the communication process.<br>
	<br>
	Like their sense of smell, Nautolan language was also maximized for use<br>
	underwater. It is not fully pronounceable in a gaseous atmosphere but they can<br>
	speak Galactic Basic with little difficulty.<br>

	"These Trade Federation types are cowards. Negotiations will be short." <br>
	-- Qui-Gon Jinn <br>
	<br>
	Neimoidians were a species of humanoids that were related to the Duros. <br>
	<br>
	They were native to the planet of Neimoidia and lived on colony worlds like<br>
	Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Neimoidians retained many similarities to the Duros, including basic form,<br>
	noseless faces, and green skin though Neimoidians tended to be grayer. Their<br>
	eyes also had pupils that split horizontally, and they were distinguished by<br>
	small lumps on their foreheads and down-turned mouths.<br>
	<br>
	Neimoidians were raised as grubs in communal hives on Neimoidia until the age<br>
	of seven standard years. The stronger and more aggressive Neimoidians for<br>
	training within corporations like the Trade Federation while the weaker and<br>
	less capable Neimoidians were sequestored.<br>
	<br>
	Neimoidians had a reputation of being skilled in matters of business and were<br>
	well known for their leadership of the Trade Federation. Unfortunately,<br>
	Neimoidians were stereotyped by other species as greedy, fearful of death,<br>
	lazy, and corrupt. This is evident by the use of droids for almost everything.<br>
	Neimoidians were also very conscious of rank, and elaborate clothing asserted<br>
	the wearer's wealth and social position in Neimoidian society. Even hats,<br>
	cloaks and drapes as well as colors and texture all had certain symbolic<br>
	meanings.<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	They were all reptilian humanoids that were noted for their leathery skin with<br>
	an average adult standing 1.8 meters tall. Somtimes these were covered in<br>
	spikes and horns.<br>
	<br>
	The varying appearance of the Nikto sub-species caused confusion amongst those<br>
	who were unfamiliar with the Nikto, but all Nikto had certain similarities;<br>
	leathery skin, sometimes covered with spikes or horns, as well as eyes that<br>
	included a protective membrane to shield against Kintan's harsh environment.<br>
	Lacking the musculature required for complex facial expressions, Nikto were<br>
	often underestimated in assessments of their intelligence due to their<br>
	'staring' eyes and 'blank' expressions.<br>
	<br>
	The mutation caused by the planet's radiation atmosphere were triggered in the<br>
	race that resulted in five different subspecies that were each adapted to a<br>
	specific environmental niche. These five reptilian species all displayed unique<br>
	cosmetic features. While each subspecies of the Nikto was physically distinct<br>
	and originated from different parts of Kintan, Nikto from different subspecies<br>
	could easily interbreed. 93% of the offspring from such unions ended up with<br>
	the characteristics of only one parent's race, with the rest combining the<br>
	traits of two subspecies.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Being cunning combatants, the battle-hardened Nikto tend to drift toward the<br>

	Arkanians; however, their species were relatively advanced compared to some.<br>

	Noghri were a primitive humanoid species. Despite their small size, they were<br>
	efficient killing machines, with claws, fangs, and an acute sense of smell.<br>
	They were much like the Wookiee species culturally, in that they respected<br>

	<br>
	Soon after the conclusion of the Clone Wars, Darth Vader discovered the planet<br>

	<br>
	Pau'an originally lived on the brush-covered surface of Utapau. When the<br>
	planet's climate shifted, forcing the Pau'an below ground, the two races formed<br>
	a symbiotic relationship. Pau'an assumed the more diplomatic and governing<br>

	Quarren or Qarren were one of the sentient species from the planet Dac, also<br>

	the Mon Calamari.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Quarren were aquatic humanoids with squid-like heads, four tentacles on their<br>

	their skin during mating rituals. They could descend to depths of 300 meters<br>
	without any breathing or pressure apparatus.<br>
	<br>
	In comparison to their Mon Calamari neighbors, the Quarren were isolationist.<br>
	They preferred the depths of their ocean homeworld to the shallow seas and the<br>
	planet's few islands. They rarely invited guests to their domain. The Quarren<br>
	also spoke their native language more frequently than Basic, in contrast to the<br>
	Mon Calamari.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Quarren are practical and conservative. They prefer the security of the<br>
	ocean depths and are unwilling to trust new ideas. Because the Calamarians<br>
	maintain a much stronger Galactic presense, Quarren have become dependant on<br>
	their shallow-water cousins. This dependancy has led to resentment and outright<br>
	hatred. Under the rumored shadow that Quarren had helped the Empire invade the<br>

	<br>
	Quermian society encourages advanced and complicated philosophical<br>

	Adult Rodians stand about 1.5 to 1.7 meters tall. Rodian pheromones have a<br>
	distinctive, pungent odor which people of many species find unpleasant.<br>
	<br>
	Rodian culture is obsessed with violence and death. Their jungle-covered<br>
	homeworld is ill-suited to agriculture, requiring Rodians to compete with<br>
	vicious predators for most of their food. Some of these predators, such as<br>
	Ghests, can wipe out entire Rodian villages. As the Rodians developed cunning<br>
	hunting tactics to survive, hunting became central to their culture.<br>
	<br>
	Rodians are also famous for their drama. Rodian theatre began as a simple<br>

	Ryn:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Ryn were an uncommon humanoid species, with prehensile tails, beak-like<br>
	noses, long fingers, white hair, and distinctive odor. They were known for<br>
	their musicality and diligent cleanliness despite being often mistaken as dirty<br>
	due to their strong odor.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Ryn are a humanoid race. Their bodies are covered in fur that primarily grows<br>
	in a short fuzz all around, with the exception of their human-like hair and the<br>
	human-like mustaches on the men. They also have prehensile tails, excellent for<br>
	grasping things. They are nomadic, with no knowledge of their original<br>
	homeworld, and are either hated, ignored, or quietly despised in every corner<br>
	of the Galaxy, notably such areas as the Corporate Sector. Ryn are fond of<br>
	dance, song, and the enjoyment of life. A peculiar habit of theirs is that a<br>
	Ryn cannot sleep in the same location twice.<br>
	<br>
	Spread over the galaxy, the Ryn's original homeworld is forgotten, even to<br>
	them. They have two theories: the first being that they were descended from<br>
	thousands of musicians hired out to a world swept clean of artists, the second<br>
	that they were the descendants of mercenaries deployed against an Inner Rim<br>
	threat. The second gained credence due to the fact that the Ryn language<br>
	contained many military words and phrases, most notably the fact that the words<br>
	for non-Ryn and civilian were related. The Ryn claimed to have invented<br>
	sabacc, originally as a means of divination. They were a very musical people,<br>
	being able to play their beaks like flutes. They could even call droids with<br>
	them, by being able to play pitches very precisely.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Ryn apparently once had an impressive warrior tradition on their homeworld,<br>
	but that was, save for their tendency to fight tenaciously, apparently lost.<br>
	Sabacc is derived from their use of it as a fortune telling tool in their<br>
	auguries, and these auguries are today favored by Hutts, who have a<br>
	superstitious belief in the card tellings. Most Ryn can be found staying under<br>
	the radar. Shunned by most other races, they often find jobs in the underworld<br>
	as smugglers, scoundrels, and informants.<br>
	<br>
	Most other races have a tendency to avoid and ignore the Ryn, which they often<br>
	use to their advantage.<br>
	<br>
	Ryn speak Galactic Basic, and are also capable of mimicking Binary with their<br>

	Sith:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Code of the Sith<br>
	Peace is a lie, there is only passion. <br>
	Through passion, I gain strength. <br>
	Through strength, I gain power. <br>
	Through power, I gain victory. <br>
	Through victory, my chains are broken. <br>
	The Force shall free me.<br>
	<br>
	The Sith were a species of red-skinned humanoids native to Ziost and Korriban<br>
	that were enslaved by exiled Dark Jedi. Over time, the Sith interbred with the<br>
	Human Dark Jedi. Eventually, the Sith species in its original form largely<br>
	vanished.<br>
	<br>
	After the rise and fall of that people, the meaning of the term 'Sith' evolved.<br>
	In time, the Sith would not be identified by their race, but by their<br>
	dedication to the ancient Sith philosophy.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The original Sith species was a Near-Human race with characteristic red skin<br>
	and long tentacle 'beards'. Eventually, the Sith were Humans who followed the<br>
	Sith ethos.<br>
	<br>
	Sith philosophy emphasized conflict. The Sith believed that it empowered both<br>
	individuals and civilizations by forcing them to change, grow, and evolve.<br>
	Conflict ensured that only the strong would survive, thus leading toward<br>
	perfection.<br>
	<br>
	The pacifistic teachings of the Jedi were viewed as obstructions to progress<br>
	lack of conflict led only to stagnation and decline. Morality was treated as an<br>
	obstacle to be overcome, obscuring the ability to recognize and grasp<br>
	opportunities for advancement.<br>
	<br>
	The core of a Sith's power came from emotion. The Jedi taught that fear and<br>
	anger were negative emotions that must be overcome, but the Sith understood<br>
	that every living creature was subject to such passions. They believed in<br>
	harnessing rather than suppressing these natural urges. They recognized that<br>
	emotion was required in order to attain a holistic understanding of the Force.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Sith are aggressive, fueling their actions with fear and anger. They are<br>
	militant extremists who thrive in an atmosphere of conflict. Sith are often<br>
	soldiers, combat pilots and spies. They revel in strife and the idea of<br>
	diplomatic or peaceful solutions are TOTALLY alien.<br>

	The Sluissi were the native species of Sluis Van. While their bodies above the<br>
	waist were humanoid, their lower halves were serpentine. Sluissi were noted for<br>
	their calm temperament, aversion to rushing and impatience, compliance to<br>
	protocol, no matter how trivial, and their technical aptitude. Sluissi could use<br>
	their tongues to sense heat.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	<br>
	Their bodies above the waist were largely humanoid and their lower halves were<br>
	serpentine. Their bodies were covered with fine scales ranging from light brown<br>
	to deep emerald green. They have round black eyes and a swooping cobra-like<br>
	hood.<br>
	<br>
	Sluissi were among the greatest starship mechanics in the galaxy. However, they<br>
	considered ship repair to be equivalent to artwork, and tended to take a very<br>
	long time in repair. Spacers learned to be patient though, as the repairs were<br>
	first rate.<br>
	<br>
	The Sluissi joined the Galactic Republic early in its history, and established<br>
	major shipyards throughout the Sluis Sector. However, during the Republic's<br>
	waning days, they became disillusioned, and were among the first to join the<br>
	Separatist cause. After the end of the Clone Wars, the Sluissi lived under<br>
	Imperial occupation. When this ended, they became valuable members of the New<br>
	Republic.<br>

	Sluissi can fill many different roles but most often were ship engineers. Sluis<br>

	Sullustan:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Sullustans were a species of small humanoids from Sullust. Sullustans, also<br>
	known as Bomewrights, were common sights for spacers. The Sullustans played an<br>
	important role in the Galactic Civil War and were charter members of the New<br>
	Republic.<br>
	<br>
	Physiology<br>
	Diminutive, Sullustans ranged from 1 to 1.5 meters in height and bore round,<br>
	tapered skulls. Sullustans were distinguishable for their almond-shaped black<br>
	eyes, facial jowls, called dewflaps and large, round ears.. Mentally,<br>
	Sullustans possessed exceptional intuition, with many able to navigate a path<br>
	after seeing a map only once. This ability extended to sublight and hyperspace<br>
	navigation, as well as patrol work, so much so that Sullustans that joined the<br>
	Rebel Alliance were put to use foiling Imperial covert operations.<br>
	<br>
	Sullustans organized themselves into familial units known as Warren-clans. Each<br>
	clan consisted of one polygamous female, several husbands and their young.<br>
	Unmated females, known as "Fems", were active members of their communities<br>
	until they reached the status of "Ready" which marked their breeding years. At<br>
	the outset of Ready, "Fems" chose their mates and founded their own<br>
	Warren-clans.<br>
	<br>
	Burial rites were given particular focus in Sullustan culture, with vast crypts<br>
	and vaults maintained by crypt masters. Death, known as "Eternal Sleep", was<br>
	viewed with great reverence. The most important of these rites as the<br>
	Tomb-walling Ceremony, an elaborate funeral procedure. from across the galaxy.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Sullustans tend to be pragmatic, pleasant and fond of practical jokes.<br>
	<br>
	Few Sullustans left their homeworld, but those that did often found employment<br>
	as pilots, merchants or ships engineers. Sullustan spacers put their skills as<br>
	navigators to use and were prized crewers across the galaxy.<br>
	<br>
	Sullustans can speak Galactic Basic. Their native language is so well known<br>
	among smugglers and pilots that speaking basic is often unnecessary.<br>

	T'Surr are little known in the galaxy at large and this is probably for the<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	T'Surr are muscle-bound hulks with males standing up to 2.5m tall. Their skin<br>

	Talz:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Talz were a large furry race with two distinct sets of eyes: one for day<br>
	vision, and one for night vision. Their homeworld was Alzoc III, a frozen world<br>
	with huge mineral wealth.<br>
	<br>
	Physiology<br>
	Talz stood over 2 meters and were covered head to toe in thick white fur, which<br>
	provided exceptional insulation and warmth. They were heavily muscled and<br>
	sported very intimidating claws on their hands and feet. Perhaps their most<br>
	remarkable feature were their four eyes. One pair of these eyes was well<br>
	adapted to see clearly in intense light, while the other pair gave the Talz the<br>
	ability to see in near total darkness.<br>
	<br>
	Talz spoke their own language, also called Talz, composed of high-pitched<br>
	chirps which seemed incongruous from such intimidating creatures. For the most<br>
	part, Talz were gentle and kind-hearted creatures.<br>
	<br>
	Imperial scouts discovered the Talz as the Emperor's New Order was finishing<br>
	off what remained of the Old Republic. The Empire recognized a species well<br>
	built for manual labor and enslaved the Talz, forcing them to work in their<br>
	mining operations. As a result, very few Talz were seen outside the Alzoc<br>
	system. Those that were found offworld were considered escaped slaves.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Talz were gentle, kind-hearted beings who were slow to anger. They lived in<br>
	hunter-gatherer nomadic villages and would normally only be found off-planet if<br>
	they had been enslaved.<br>
	<br>
	Only those Talz whove left Alzoc would have encountered any technology at all.<br>
	While they take to it fairly quickly, advanced applications such as engineering<br>

	The Togruta were a humanoid species from the planet Shili. In order to protect<br>

	slow-witted beasts.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Togruta had mostly red skin, with lighter patches around the eyes. Their heads<br>
	bore large horns and tentacles similar to Twi'lek lekku, with a bold striped<br>
	pattern. They are of a very similar height and build to humans.<br>
	<br>
	Togruta enjoy devouring thimiars, small rodents native to Shili. Togrutas had<br>
	sharp teeth and when they bit into their furry little quarry, the creature's<br>
	postmortem spasms gave the incorrect impression that Togruta were venomous.<br>
	Togrutas take advantage of this intimidating reputation and do nothing to<br>

	Toong:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	The Toong were an anti-social species of big-headed aliens from the planet<br>

	of Tund.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Toong spoke the language Toongese. The Toong had long gangly legs, no neck, and<br>
	bulbous bodies. Their eyes were high on their pointed forehead, and their<br>
	cheeks were jowled. Toong could store food in their cheeks, much like the<br>
	rodents they were assumed to have evolved from.<br>
	<br>
	When the Old Republic made first contact with the Toong in years unknown, the<br>
	species was barely beginning the first steps to exploring their home system. A<br>
	world war triggered, and this came as a shock to first contact specialist who<br>
	had observed the species and documented them as being peace-loving and<br>
	outgoing. It took weeks to reestablish contact with the Toong. It took the<br>
	intervention of the Jedi and first contact specialist from Coruscant to stop<br>
	the massive warfare that was threatening to doom the species.<br>
	<br>
	After joining the Old Republic, the Toong took rapidly to advanced technology.<br>

	showed sparse whiskers. Their wings could beat as fast as ten times a second<br>
	burning up lots of energy in the process. To fuel their wings, the species ate<br>
	concentrated foods and egg-seeds. Their bellies were also filled with a bouyant<br>
	gas to help them stay afloat, thus the pot belly.<br>
	<br>
	They have small legs that they can walk on, but most ofthem spend the majority<br>

	Trandoshan:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Trandoshans were large, reptilian humanoids from the planet Trandosha (or<br>
	Dosha). They had supersensitive eyes that could see into the infrared range and<br>
	the ability to regenerate lost limbs when they were young. They would also<br>
	periodically shed their skin. The Trandoshans were a warlike species who allied<br>
	early with the Empire, taking Wookiees as slaves.<br>
	<br>
	Physiology And History<br>
	Trandoshan are strong, reptilian humanoids ranging from 1.6 to 2.1 meters tall.<br>
	Their scale hides range from sandy brown to glossy green. They have three<br>
	thick-clawed fingers that lack the dexterity of most humanoid species. Their<br>
	society revolves around hunting and they worship a female diety who rewards<br>
	Trandoshans for their success or failure in the hunt.<br>
	<br>
	The Trandoshans originated on Trandosha, also known as Dosha or Hsskor. It was<br>
	in the same star system as Kashyyyk, the homeworld of the Wookiees. In 7,000<br>
	BBY, the Trandoshans joined the Galactic Republic. Despite this, they were only<br>
	indirectly represented in the Galactic Senate by the Wookiee Yarua, much to the<br>
	Trandoshans' dismay. Trandoshan terrorists then attempted to assassinate Yarua<br>
	in 32 BBY. Subsequent relations between the species have deteriorated since.<br>
	<br>
	After the Clone Wars, the Trandoshans suggested to the Empire that they use the<br>
	Wookiees as slaves. The Empire, seeing cheap labor, agreed and hired the<br>
	Trandoshans to lead slaving raids on Kashyyyk and locate runaway slaves.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Trandoshans are aggressive, selfish and brutal beings. Though they value<br>
	credits over friendship, the honor of the hunt obliges them to a life-debt if<br>
	another saves them from certain death. Trandoshans crave the thrill of battle.<br>
	Some Trandoshan leave Dosh to become soldiers or mercenaries. Their warrior<br>
	skills and ruthlessness make them valued muscle for hire throughout the galaxy.<br>
	<br>
	Because of Wookiees enslavement by Tradoshans, there is NO CHANCE of<br>

	The two most striking features of a Twi'lek are their broad range of skin<br>
	coloration within the species and head tails. The head tails, known as "lekku",<br>
	protrude down the back of the skull and contain part of a Twi'lek's brain.<br>
	A Twi'lek's head tails serve many purposes in their daily lives and culture,<br>
	storing water and being used as erogenous zones. The native language of the<br>
	Twi'leks also uses a combination of words and subtle lekku movements.<br>
	<br>
	The range of possible Twi'lek skin colors is extremely diverse, including<br>
	green, orange, brown, yellow, blue, white, and purple - all in varying shades<br>
	and hues. Twi'leks of these skin colors were referred to as Ryloth Twi'leks,<br>
	with green being the most common color. Other types of Twi'leks included the<br>
	particularly rare turquoise-skinned Twi'leks, known as Rutian Twi'leks, and<br>
	the rarest red pigment of the 'Lethan' Twi'leks.<br>

	Twilek are calculating, pragmatic and charismatic beings. They prefer to duck<br>
	in the shadows and from a safe hiding place, observe, plan and profit from the<br>
	outcome. Because of this, many twi'leks lived their lives as merchants,<br>
	diplomats or even criminals. The race also has a reputation for producing<br>

	Ubese:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Ubese are a near-human race of mercenaries, smugglers and bounty hunters. These<br>
	nomadic survivors of their home system's destruction have a very long standing<br>
	(and well-founded) hatred of all things Jedi. They are mostly known as vicious<br>
	savages, scavaging on the fringes of the galactic core.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Out of their protective environmental helmets, Ubese appear to be lean baseline<br>
	humans. They tend to have fair skin and darker hair tones with little of no<br>
	facial or body hair. Their high-set cheekbones can appear striking until their<br>
	ugly inner nature becomes more evident.<br>
	<br>
	Uba III, their original home world, was a peaceful backwater world until they<br>
	made contact with outside races. The massive influx of new technologies<br>
	initially helped the Ubese, improving many aspects of their lives. However,<br>
	these new technologies stressed the traditional organizations of their society,<br>
	fracturing clan allegiances that had endured millenia. In a very short time,<br>
	Ubese grew much less trusting and more selfish and spiteful.<br>
	<br>
	During the New Sith Wars, the new technologies had propelled the Ubese into the<br>
	dominant force in the surrounding few star systems. When the local Jedi<br>
	diplomats discovered that the Ubese were hoarding illegal weapons capable of<br>
	planet wide destruction, they decided to move against them.<br>
	<br>
	This pre-emptive strike accidentally detonated the Ubese weaponry unleashing a<br>
	nuclear holocaust that obliterated the Ubese race. Uba I, Uba II and Uba V were<br>
	reduced to uninhabitable radioactive wastelands while Uba III, their home<br>
	world, shattered into an asteroid field. Uba IV was scarcely livable with 90%<br>
	of all arable land and potable water poisoned beyond reclamation. The local<br>
	Jedi diplomats hushed the atrocities up, erasing the Uba system from star<br>
	charts and Galactic databases, abandoning the surviving Ubese to their fate on<br>
	the seared remains of Uba IV.<br>
	<br>
	The Ubese have been somewhat irritable since that time.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Ubese, though rare in the galaxy, are united by their hatred and contempt for<br>
	all other species. They make a living as assassins, mercenaries, bounty<br>
	hunters, thugs...really any profession where they get to officially hate<br>
	others. They always wear armor or environmental suits with sealed helmets that<br>
	cover their heads. Because they're more accustomed to breathing nuclear vapor,<br>
	they must wear special breathing apparatus when in standard nitrogen-oxygen<br>
	atmospheres.<br>
	<br>
	No other race hates Jedi more than the Ubese. They were very prominent as<br>
	trackers and assassins during the Jedi Purge, volunteering their skills to<br>
	Darth Vader's hunts. They blame Jedi entirely for what happened to their race.<br>
	<br>
	Ubese can speak Galactic Basic in a harsh whisper but are so contemptuous of<br>
	other races their largely refuse to speak it.<br>

	<br>
	Utai are the original inhabitants of the valleys and sinkholes of Utapau,<br>
	living far below the planet's surface. When the planet's climate shifted,<br>
	forcing the Pau'an below ground, the two races formed a symbiotic relationship.<br>
	Pau'an assumed the more diplomatic and governing roles, presenting the public<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Verpine appear as a 2 m tall preying mantis whose stick-like bodies are covered<br>
	with brilliant green chitin plates. Their two large black eyes allowed them to<br>
	have keen vision that could pick out microscopic details. Verpine also can<br>
	sense and transmit radio waves to communicate with other Verpine in Verpine<br>
	language.<br>
	<br>
	The Verpine have been spacefarers for their entire history. Their society is<br>
	based around absolute majority rule, with decisions made instantly through<br>
	their natural radio communication.<br>
	<br>
	The largest Verpine settlement in the galaxy lies in the Roche asteroid field.<br>
	The Verpines advanced technology generates atmosphere and artificial gravity in<br>
	hollowed-out asteroids.<br>
	<br>
	Verpine came in two types -- intelligent, hermaphroditic Verpine and<br>
	unintelligent worker drones. At the time of their entrance into galactic<br>
	society, only five percent of Verpine were intelligent. After the change,<br>
	egg-laying Verpine used a special enzyme to ensure all eggs laid developed into<br>
	intelligent Verpine. Any drones needed by a Verpine hive were produced via<br>
	cloning.<br>

	Vurks were the predominant sapient species of the planet Sembla. They resembled<br>
	tall reptilian humanoids with bulbous eyes and sweeping head crests. Their<br>
	hands and feet had three digits each, one of them opposed.<br>
	<br>
	Being able to breathe both water and air, they were perfectly adapted to travel<br>
	Sembla's warm, shallow seas dotted with volcanic islands. They shared a strong<br>
	nomadic instinct with their amphibious ancestors. Because their way of living<br>
	resulted in virtually no sizeable permanent settlement whatsoever, Vurks were<br>

	Weequay:`<font color=#00FF00>Overview</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Weequays were a race of humanoids who came from the Outer Rim planet of<br>
	Sriluur, near Hutt Space. Their home was a harsh desert planet, leading to the<br>
	species' tanned skin tone and rough, sandy, wrinkled skin. Their eyes were dark<br>
	and slightly recessed into their skull.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Weequay were humanoids with leathery skin, a flat nose, lipless mouth and a<br>
	bony ridge along their neck. They often braid their hair into one or more top<br>
	knots.<br>
	<br>
	Weequay had no need for a name within their clan. Even Weequay who had to live<br>
	among other clans, or among non-Weequay were usually referred to as "Weequay". <br>
	In Weequay culture,individual identity was much less important than the clan.<br>
	As long as the clan survived, a single Weequay was expendable. This resulted <br>
	in a sometimes brutal culture.<br>
	<br>
	Weequays had the ability to communicate with members of their own clan through<br>
	smell by exuding complex pheromones. As a result, speech was only a secondary<br>
	form of communication for Weequay, and they seldom spoke a whole sentence,<br>
	resulting in Humans mistakenly believing the species to be unintelligent.<br>
	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Role in LotJ</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Weequay were occasionally hired as bodyguards in Hutt syndicates. They<br>
	generally went offworld as part of small groups, usually from the same clan.<br>
	Their role in the galaxy was usually minor, as their mean-spirited temperaments<br>
	left them ill-suited for more grand ventures, while their suspicious and<br>

	The shaggy aliens are well suited to such frigid environments, with thick coats<br>
	of fur and fat to retain their body heat. Whiphids are powerful swimmers, and<br>
	their fur sheds water, allowing them to swim freely in the cold seas. The<br>
	greatest of Whiphids stand two-and-a-half meters tall, and weigh over 400<br>
	kilograms.<br>
	<br>
	They are ferocious predators with a true love of the hunt. They are extremely<br>
	talented trackers with a keen sense of smell. Their strength and claws allow<br>
	them to tackle game barehanded, though most prefer simple cutting implements<br>
	and spears as weapons. The most influential Whiphid in a tribe is the most<br>
	successful hunter, who is given the title Spearmaster.<br>
	<br>
	Whiphid technology is extremely primitive, and the aliens live in crude yet<br>
	effective shelters built of rocks, skins, and mastmot bones. They hollow out<br>
	temporary snow shelters during their migratory months, returning to their more<br>
	permanent communities of three to ten families in the brief summers. Whiphids<br>

	<br>
	<font color=#00FF00>Physiology And Culture</font><font color=#C0C0C0><br>
	Wroonians were nearly identical to Humans. Wroonians could be distinguished<br>
	from baseline humans not only by their blue skin (even blue lips), but by their<br>
	yellow irises.<br>
	<br>
	Wroona's early oceans were filled with merchants seeking their fortune,<br>
	explorers seeking new and rich lands, and pirates waiting in the coves to take<br>
	all the riches away from everyone else. This rich history carries into the<br>
	lives of modern Wroonians. These people are renown for joining pirate and<br>
	mercenary bands, and becoming successful free-traders, scouts and smugglers.<br>
	<br>
	Wroonian society has always emphasized personal gain and material possessions. <br>
	Each Wroonian has a different sense of what possessions are valued most in<br>
	life, and what kinds of activities to profit from. Wealth can be measured in<br>
	credits, land, the number of starships one has, or the number of contracts or<br>
	jobs a Wroonian has had.<br>
	<br>
	The average Wroonian is quite accepting of her fate - in most Wroonian<br>
	professions, death is often a risk, yet the gain of credits and prestige (in<br>
	the average Wroonian's mind) far outweighs this risk. Their easy-going nature<br>
	makes them almost naturals at making deals and meeting the right contacts. <br>
